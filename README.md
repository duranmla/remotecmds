* linux `espeak` command: `echo "I wanna Go!"|espeak` http://espeak.sourceforge.net/
* Windows users might want to look at [ptts](http://jampal.sourceforge.net/ptts.html) or [espeak](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/)
* OS X has a `screencapture` command
* Windows has a free tool called [NirCmd](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/nircmd.html) to do a bunch of things.
